This is a script to ask questions about network ports from different protocol needed for CompTIA A+ exam.
It is entirely made from rust. (I am up-scaling(oooh fancy) my skills in rust).

If you guys have any pull requests or issues (I still have no idea how github works (But I am gonna learn)).
Feel free to notify me :).
